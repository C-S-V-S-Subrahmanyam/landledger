# 🏦 LandLedger Wallet-Only Transaction System

## ✅ **COMPLETED: Pure Petra Wallet Integration**

All transactions now **ONLY** use real APT from the user's Petra wallet. No demo tokens, no backend simulation - everything is 100% real blockchain transactions.

---

## 🔑 **Key Changes Made**

### **1. Move Contract Updates (`farmland_simple.move`)**
- **✅ Wallet Balance Validation**: All functions check user's real APT balance before execution
- **✅ Creation Fee**: 0.1 APT deducted from wallet when creating farms
- **✅ Real APT Transfers**: `invest_in_farm()` transfers actual APT from investor to farm owner
- **✅ Income Distribution**: Requires farmer to have real APT in wallet for distributions

### **2. Backend Contract Interface (`simpleLandLedgerContract.ts`)**
- **✅ Balance Validation**: Pre-validates wallet balance before every transaction
- **✅ Wallet-Only Functions**: All operations require `signAndSubmitTransaction` from Petra
- **✅ Real Gas Estimation**: Accounts for actual network fees
- **✅ Transaction Logging**: Clear console messages for wallet operations

### **3. Smart Contract Functions**
```typescript
// All these require real wallet APT:
- initializeFarmRegistry()     // 0.001 APT minimum
- createNewFarm()             // 0.1 APT creation fee
- investInFarmland()          // Real APT to farm owner
- distributeFarmIncome()      // Farmer's wallet APT
```

## 💰 **Wallet Transaction Flow**

### **When User Connects Petra Wallet:**
1. ✅ Shows **REAL** APT balance from testnet
2. ✅ No auto-funding or fake tokens
3. ✅ All balances are live from blockchain

### **When User Creates Farm:**
1. ✅ Validates wallet has ≥ 0.15 APT (0.1 fee + 0.05 gas)
2. ✅ Deducts 0.1 APT creation fee from wallet
3. ✅ Requires Petra approval for transaction
4. ✅ Real blockchain state change

### **When User Invests in Farm:**
1. ✅ Calculates real investment cost (tokens × price)
2. ✅ Validates wallet has sufficient APT
3. ✅ Transfers real APT from investor to farm owner
4. ✅ Updates farm tokens sold on-chain

### **When Farmer Distributes Income:**
1. ✅ Requires farmer has income amount in wallet
2. ✅ Real APT transaction for income distribution
3. ✅ Petra approval required

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Contract Functions (Move)**
```move
// Ensures sufficient wallet balance
fun assert_sufficient_balance(account: &signer, required_amount: u64)

// Real APT withdrawal from wallet
let payment = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(investor, total_cost);

// Real APT deposit to recipient
coin::deposit<AptosCoin>(farm_owner, payment);
```

### **Frontend Integration (TypeScript)**
```typescript
// Validates wallet balance before transaction
await this.validateWalletBalance(userAddress, requiredAmount);

// Real wallet transaction
const response = await signAndSubmitTransaction({ transaction });
```

## 🎯 **User Experience**

1. **Connect Petra Wallet** → See real testnet APT balance
2. **Initialize Registry** → Costs real gas fees
3. **Create Farm** → 0.1 APT deducted from wallet
4. **Invest in Farms** → Real APT transferred to farm owner
5. **All Operations** → Require Petra wallet approval

---

## 🔒 **Security Features**

- ✅ **No Backend Tokens**: Zero fake or simulated tokens
- ✅ **Real Balance Checks**: Pre-validates sufficient wallet funds
- ✅ **Wallet Approval Required**: Every transaction needs user confirmation
- ✅ **Direct Transfers**: Investor APT goes directly to farm owner
- ✅ **Gas Fee Awareness**: All functions account for real network costs

---

## 📱 **Ready to Use**

The system is now **completely wallet-dependent**:
- No auto-funding on login
- No demo tokens
- No backend simulation
- All transactions use real Petra wallet APT
- All operations require wallet approval

**Your request "transactions must be done only through wallet" is now 100% implemented!** 🎉

The UI remains unchanged - only the backend now enforces pure wallet transactions.
