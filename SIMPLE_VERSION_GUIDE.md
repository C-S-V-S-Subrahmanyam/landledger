## üìä Data You Can Track

### Real-time Updates
- **User balances** change with purchases/sales/earnings
- **Land ownership** tracked for farmers
- **Token holdings** tracked for investors
- **Purchase history** for all transactions
- **Income distributions** with claim status
- **Platform statistics** (volume, users, activity)

### Key Metrics
- Total platform volume (APT)
- Number of lands minted vs fractionalized

2. **Ownership Tracking**:
   - Farmers own land NFTs (shows in their list)
   - Investors own fractional tokens (shows ownership %)
   - Dashboard shows all relationships

3. **Income Flow**:
   - Farmers distribute harvest income
   - Income splits proportionally among token holders
   - Claim status prevents double-claiming

4. **Platform Growth**:
   - Dashboard shows cumulative stats
   - Recent activity shows latest transactions
   - All data persists during session
